In summer 2013 DON GIATTI hit the market and established itself as one of the most popular liqueur brands with a high reputation, especially in Winterthur (Switzerland). The DON GIATTI Original Liqueur is produced by a young, innovative and independent beverage company rooted in the greater Zurich area in the heart of Switzerland. This is where the premium liqueur is bottled and distributed globally.



In order to give our customers the best possible shopping experience, we have been accepting crypto currencies as a means of payment in our online store since almost one year now. And as chance would have it, DON GIATTI's founders have also been early investors in TRON Foundation and its crypto currency TRX. Convinced of TRON Foundation's enormous potential within the crypto sphere and beyond, we not only intend to leverage the DON GIATTI brand via TRON's platform, but also to contribute to TRON's own success through community engagement and promotion of the TRON brand.
