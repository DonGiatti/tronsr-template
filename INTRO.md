What we do

- DON GIATTI stands for a sophisticated liqueur based on Swiss ingredients.

- DON GIATTI was founded by two Swiss: Philippe and Leon with a passion for innovative product engineering. We                   firmly believe that the only keys to success are human capital and passion.

- DON GIATTI is pure Swiss â€“ from founders over production to bottling all located in the small town of Winterthur near Zurich.

- DON GIATTI is sold internationally, foremost in Switzerland, Germany, and Thailand.
