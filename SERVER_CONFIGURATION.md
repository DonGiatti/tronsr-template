This is our testable node/witness (35.180.118.36:50051) (Paris)

Server configuration before 26th June:

- This setup for main node will start running in June, providing the first blocks: x1.16xlarge 64 core 1T memory 20T SSD storage (EBS) 25G bandwidth (EU (Frankfurt)), in combination with failover scripting as well as Anti-Ddos via AWS Shield, to provide a stable and secure environment for the main node.

- As a backup node environment we will provide a setup as following: x1e.2xlarge 8 core 244GB memory 2T SSD storage (EBS) 25G bandwidth (EU (Irland))

- As a test node environment, we will provide a setup as following for providing the first blocks: r4.xlarge 4 core 30GB memory 8GB SSD storage (EBS) 10G bandwidth (EU (Paris))

Plans for Hardware Expansion as TRON SR:

- Further Expansion (July 2018): Adding a second main node with corresponding backup: 
x1.16xlarge 64 core 1T memory 1T SSD storage (EBS) 25G bandwidth

- Further Expansion (August 2018): Adding a third main node with corresponding backup:
x1.16xlarge 64 core 1T memory 1T SSD storage (EBS) 25G bandwidth

- Further Expansion (September 2018): Adding a fourth main node with corresponding backup:
x1.16xlarge 64 core 1T memory 1T SSD storage (EBS) 25G bandwidth

We will provide failover scripting as well as Anti-Ddos via AWS Shield, to provide a stable and secure environment for the main node. To backup the server extension environment, we will choose another world region to have a stable setup in case of negative externalities. The dual-system backup will be equivalent to the corresponding specification of the monthly extension plans, as mentioned above.
