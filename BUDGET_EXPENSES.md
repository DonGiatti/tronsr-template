The estimated budget spent before 26th June is around 18â€™000$ for corresponding hardware for main node and test node. After 26th June we planned our rewards distribution as follows:

- 45% given back to TRON community, irrespective of the market value per TRX:

  - 40% for voters as an incentive for voting
  - 2.5% for rewards for shopping at a local store (worldwide) and at our DON GIATTI online store
  - 2.5% will go into the TRON GIATTI Foundation. In general, funds can be requested for blockchain based projects and for sponsoring events to promote TRON.

- 25% used for maintenance and upgrade of servers. Percentage dependent on market value per TRX (calculated with 0.1 USD/TRX). If surplus funds remain, we will distribute it to the community and voters.

- 15% reinvested in the DON GIATTI brand (e.g. for a limited TRON GIATTI edition), in collaboration with TRON and its community. Percentage dependent on the market value per TRX (calculated with 0.1 USD/TRX).

- 13% locked away and serves as a long-term investment. Significant surge of market value per TRX expected in the long term.

- 2% set aside for administrative costs (e.g. for legal expenses or team funds).
